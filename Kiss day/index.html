      Happy Kiss Day, my love 💋<br><br>

      There are so many things I want to tell you,  
      but every time I look at you… my heart speaks louder than my words.<br><br>

      You are not just someone I love.  
      You are the calm in my chaos,  
      the softness in my hardest days,  
      the warmth I never knew I needed.<br><br>

      If I could be anywhere right now,  
      I would choose to stand close to you,  
      hold your face gently,  
      and give you a kiss that carries  
      all the love I feel but cannot fully explain.<br><br>

      Harini…  
      every kiss from you feels like home ❤️
